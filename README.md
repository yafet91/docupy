docupy
======

Documentation generator that supports many languages, written in python (as the name implies) ~

DOCUPY ~._ is an application that tries to make the job of documenting
	your code a task that does not kill you in the process. We all know
	that the awful moment just after the great moment after finishing a 
	project, when we realize we have to document it. Well, DOCUPY will do 
	it for you using the comments in your source. Use the special docupy 
	chars: 		~.   in your comments so that DOCUPY understands your code
	and build the documentation. For more info scroll down ~._

	Have fun documentin'! (first person to ever say that)
