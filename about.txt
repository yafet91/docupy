About :
	DOCUPY ~._ is an application that tries to make the job of documenting
	your code a task that does not kill you in the process. We all know
	that the awful moment just after the great moment after finishing a 
	project, when we realize we have to document it. Well, DOCUPY will do 
	it for you using the comments in your source. Use the special docupy 
	chars: 		~.   in your comments so that DOCUPY understands your code
	and build the documentation. For more info scroll down ~._
	



The design idea :

	- Flexibility and Extendibility
	- Speed and Organization
	- Support for all languages (except those that already have apps like this (javadoc and whatnot))

Input is root directory containing text documents (source code)

Currently supported are :
	- Javascript source code

~ Others on the way ;)

Currently working on :
	- support for Python source code
